      <p>You can start by selecting new from the file menu. By default, Chordwriter creates an <strong>LMF (Leadsheet
          Music File)</strong> when you create a new song. When you save the file, you can choose to also save it as a
        ChordPro file or OnSong file.</p>
      <p>Each song is split into &quot;sections&quot;, such as verses, chorus, bridge, etc. To create a section click on
        the &quot;plus&quot; icon in the upper right corner. Once you create a section, you can add lines (lyrics) by
        clicking on the &quot;plus&quot; icon by the name of each section.</p>
      <h3>Dealing with Chords</h3>
      <p>Chords can be created by clicking on syllables in a line. There are two options for creating chords. If you are
        editing a Leadsheet Music File, the chord editor will give you fields based on the <a
          href="#chord-concept">Leadsheet chord concept</a>. If you are not using a Leadsheet Music File,
        it will show a basic text editor to enter the chord you want.</p>

      <h3>Chord Prediction</h3>
      <p>Only available in Leadsheet Music Files</p>
      <p>Chordwriter automatically splits words into their respective syllables to assign each chord. The reason for this
        is that after you add chords to the first of a particular group, i.e. verse 1, it will automatically copy the
        chords to other sections without additional work. This is why you must specify a type when creating a group.
        Although you will not see the repeated chords in the editor, they are present in the print preview.</p>

      <h2 id="chord-concept">The Leadsheet Chord Concept</h2>
      <picture class="invert">

        <img src="../images/chord-format-layout.png" alt="III# maj sus4 / I" />
      </picture>
      <p>Both Leadsheet and Chordwriter store chords in a proprietary format. Each chord can be split up into five
        different components. Not all of these components are used, and only the bash chord is required.</p>
      <p>Chordwriter understands basic music theory, and so a key is only required when you need to render the song. The
        base chord is <strong>I - VII</strong> in a musical scale. It will automatically determine the mood based on the
        position in the scale at runtime. The mood field is used when you want to override what the program would normally
        display. You also may need to use a chord that is not in the scale. You can use the <strong>flat/sharp
          option</strong> to adjust the base note by a half step. Not that the flat/sharp option will not affect the bass
        note.</p>
      <p>Unlike the previous options, the <strong>extension</strong> and <strong>bass</strong> option stand on their own
        and do not affect the bass chord. The extension adds various addtions to the chord such as sevenths, suspensions,
        add9s, etc. The bass field represents the note that should be played by the bass player or by the left hand on
        piano.</p>

      <h2 id="import-export">Import and Exporting Files</h2>
      <p>Chordwriter currently supports importing from and exporting to Leadsheet, ChordPro, and OnSong formats. It can
        also export to a text file for use in worship presentation programs. Chordwriter's support for importing and
        export are listed here.</p>

      <p><sup>1</sup>Chordwriter will try to import if the chords are in a ChordPro format.<br /><sup>2</sup>Depends on
        the source music document.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>For the other category, Chordwriter will do its best to import based on known patterns for encoding chord
        information. We cannot garuntee that it will be intelligible, much less correct.</p>
      <p>Is there a format you would like to see supported? <a href="contact">Let me know</a> and I will do my best to

          <p>A Leadsheet Music File is an XML-based storage format that is highly structured. It is seperated into several
            sections, <strong>properties, encoding, and music</strong>.</p>
          <p>The first section, properties, contains basic information about the song, such as the authors of the song as
            well as any ID numbers associated with the song. Note that the song name is also at the root level.</p>

          <p>The encoding section contains information about the program that created the file and also the capabilities
            the song supports. It also specifies when the song was created and edited.</p>
          <p>The file also allows you to specify what keys are supported (default is all), and what type of music the song
            contains. As of now, only the chord sheet is enabled, as no specification for storing lead or harmonic

          <p>Chord repeating is based on the principle that similar sections (like verses) will all have the same poetic

      <h2 id="chordpro-format">ChordPro File Format</h2>
      <p>Leadsheet can also read and edit the widely used ChordPro file format. It encodes chords using braces like
        <strong>[Dm]</strong> and uses braces to define directives and other metadata. There is no standard format for
        ChordPro files so directive support varies by program. Here are a list of directives supported by Chordwriter. Be
        aware that unsupported directives will be ignored and will not be included when you save the file.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>{title: ...}</strong> or <strong>{t: ...}</strong> The title of the song.</li>
        <li><strong>{subtitle: ...}</strong>, <strong>{st: ...}</strong> or <strong>{su: ...}</strong> The artist name or
          any other byline information. You can specify multiple artists by separating names with a semi-colon. - <em>Kim
            Walker-Smith; Chris Quilala</em></li>
        <li><strong>{artist: ...}</strong> or <strong>{a: ...}</strong> The artist name or any other byline information.
          You can specify multiple artists by separating names with a semi-colon. - <em>Kim Walker-Smith; Chris
            Quilala</em></li>
        <li><strong>{key: ...}</strong> or <strong>{k: ...}</strong> or <strong>{ok: ...}</strong> The key of the song
          written as a key with enharmonic preference and an optional "m" to indicate minor. - <em>alphabetic, e.g. Bb or
            Em</em></li>
        <li><strong>{tempo: ...}</strong> The beats per minute (BPM) - <em>numeric</em></li>
        <li><strong>{time: ...}</strong> The time signature - <em>numeric beat over bar e.g. 3/4</em></li>
        <li><strong>{copyright: ...}</strong> or <strong>{footer: ...}</strong> Specifies copyright footer text to appear
          at the bottom of the page or lyrics projection.</li>
        <li><strong>{ccli: ...}</strong> The CCLI number of the song.</li>
        <li><strong>{leadsheet: ...}</strong> The Leadsheet (online) ID number of the song.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As of now, Chorwriter supports a simple set of ChordPro music directives. Again, any unrecognized directives will
        be ignored and that information may be lost when you save the file.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>{comment: ...}</strong> or <strong>{c: ...}</strong> or <strong>{comment_bold: ...}</strong> or
          <strong>{cb: ...}</strong> or <strong>{comment_italic: ...}</strong> or <strong>{ci: ...}</strong> or
          <strong>{guitar_comment: ...}</strong> or <strong>{gc: ...}</strong> Defines a comment. Chordwriter will
          interpret this as a section title.</li>
        <li><strong>{start_of_verse}</strong> or <strong>{sov}</strong> Specifies the start of a verse.</li>
        <li><strong>{end_of_verse}</strong> or <strong>{eov}</strong> Specifies the end of a verse.</li>
        <li><strong>{start_of_bridge}</strong> or <strong>{sob}</strong> Specifies the start of a bridge.</li>
        <li><strong>{end_of_bridge}</strong> or <strong>{eob}</strong> Specifies the end of a bridge.</li>
        <li><strong>{start_of_chorus}</strong> or <strong>{soc}</strong> Specifies the start of a chorus.</li>
        <li><strong>{end_of_chorus}</strong> or <strong>{eoc}</strong> Specifies the end of a chorus.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We are continuing to improve our support for the ChordPro file format. If you have suggestions or functionality
        you would like to see supported in later versions, please <a href="contact">let us know</a> so we can make that
        happen. We are working on support for chord tabulature support, both automatically generated and custom tabs.</p>
